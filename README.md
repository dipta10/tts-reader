# TTS Reader
Select text and read aloud

### Disclaimer
This is my pet project. I switched from Windows to Ubuntu, mainly for i3wm and because my potato laptop works way faster here.
I was looking for an alternative for TTS reader where with a keybind I can make the app read the selected text aloud.

Since I didn't find a standalone application that can do it or perform as good as TTS Readers available on Windows, I decided to create one for myself as a side project.
